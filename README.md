## ü§ì Assumptions: 
- You have mysql installed and running
- Postman installed and running
- You have Java 11 or higher installed
- Compatible browser such as Google Chrome

# Application has 2Ô∏è‚É£ sections
## ‚ò∏ API
- The API is used to consume Joke of the day from with the request URL: Copyright ¬©`https://api.jokes.one/jod` from Copyright ¬©`2019-20 https://jokes.one`
- This uses a scheduler to get the joke of the day (JOD) from the joke API and store it a SQL database
- A controller for the API has been added for convenience to get the jokes without waiting for the scheduler


## üß∞ Application
- Used to create your own jokes and store in SQL database
- Allows you to create, read update, and delete jokes (CRUD)

The above can be done in two way: Using Swagger or Postman Collection

# üöÄ Starting the application

- Execute the `schema.sql` file to create the schema titled:`jokes`
- Change the mysql user and password configuration in the application.yml if need be to suit your configuration
- Open the application in your respective IDE for Java. Such as Intellij IDEA, VS Code or Netbeans
- Run the application, build will start with all MAVEN dependencies being downloaded, the application will be start up on port `5000`
- When the service is running import the `Persistent_Jokes.postman_collection.json` file in Postman
- Send the HTTP request in the Postman collection to interact with the application 
- Alternatively access the Swagger UI on `http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html` and try out the available end points

### Swagger 2
- After successfully starting the application.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html` to see and try out the available rest endpoints for both the application and API.

### Postman <a href="https://postman.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"> <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/getpostman/getpostman-icon.svg" alt="postman" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 
- After successfully starting the application.
- Import the `Persistent_Jokes.postman_collection.json` for the application request calls
- Gives you the following:
    - GET methods
        - getJokeById
        - getAllJokes
    - POST method
        - saveJoke
    - PUT method
        - updateJoke
    - DELETE method 
        - deleteJoke
- Import `Persistent_Jokes_API.postman_collection.json` for the API request calls
- Gives you the following:
    - GET methods
        - JokeOfTheDay
        - Jokes
            - Requires a paid api token from api.joke.one which should be placed in the configuration file to execute this get request
        
  ## üß™ Unit Tests
   - Run `JokesServiceTest` file to execute unit tests which use the H2 database
   - The tests also use sample data under the `resources` directory for `jod` and `jokes`
